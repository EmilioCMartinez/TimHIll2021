Tim Hill 2021 pre all star break


Tim Hill has been somewhat hard to assess so far this season, at least for me. He has a 1.17 WHIP and a 54% GB rate which seem to be a good combination considering his arm slot, but looking at his hit density and pitch chart for this season, he seems to be getting away with a decent amount of pitches in dangerous locations. This makes me wonder how he will do facing hitters from a lineup for the Nth time, especially a team like the Dodgers. His sinker and four seam do not have amazing movement profiles or velocities either, so there is an assumption to be made that either 1) His arm slot is making it extremely hard for hitters or 2) His VAA is so 'flat' in comparison to the rest of the league, that he can continue to live in the upper parts of the zone more effectively than someone with a steeper VAA
